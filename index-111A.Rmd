# Home

This website contains selected materials from my 193L class (Intro to R) that you may find useful to review before 111A. This is not required, and all necessary material will be covered in class. However, you may find it useful to review some of this beforehand to get a jump start on things.

Please ignore the "Text Cleaning" chapter, as well as the "Using across() with summarize()" section of the "Summarizing Data" chapter. There may be some links that don't work because I just quickly frankenstein'd material from my other class, but overall it should function!
